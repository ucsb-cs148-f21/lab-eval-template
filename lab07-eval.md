- [] (40 pts, team) You earn these team points if you a) expanded the Design Document by summarizing important team decisions referring to meetings logged in your GitHub repo, and b) created a new Section in your Design Document talking about your User Experience (UX) considerations. A high-level task/user flow (see below) might be the first thing to document there, and it will also be helpful for determining the structure of your manual (see next bullet).

- [] (40 pts, team) You earn these team points if you started a user manual document that you link to in your Github ./docs/MANUAL.md and that contains at the very least a description of the product purpose, lists the intended user audience, and has section headings (which are allowed to change later on) with placeholder information (could even be Lorem Ipsum text for now) that in the future should document the various features of your product and how to operate them (with plenty of screenshots).

- [] (20 pts, team) You earn these team points based on the attendance/participation in your third and last retrospective on Wed, 11/17 (or whenever your team opts to hold it); 3.34 per team member for teams of 6, 4 per team member for teams of five, 5 points per team member for teams of four.
