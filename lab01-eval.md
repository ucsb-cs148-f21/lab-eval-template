## Part 2 (20 points)

- [ ] log your first Scrum meetings (including lab01.md and lec02.md) in the sprint01 subfolder.

- [ ] account for all members of your group

- [ ] the meeting notes the scribe took are added to the above files. 

- [ ] Ensure the notes match the format displayed in Lecture1 slides.

- [ ] For future meetings, you will replace lab01 with the respective meeting time denominator (e.g. lec05 or 10-17 2pm)

## Part 3 (20 points)

- [ ] create problem_scenario.md and user_journey.md in the team directory

## Part 4 (20 points, individual)

- [ ] Demo a "Hello World!" program in the tech stack of your choice.

## Part 5 (20 points, individual/team)

- [ ] As part of this grade, each team member should have contributed to a hello world assignment as an individual or as part of a group by the due date/time of this lab, i.e. (Fri, Oct 08 at 11:59PM)

- [ ] For teams of 5, this part of your grade is 6 points per team member. For teams of 4, it is 7.5 points. Those points are all or nothing; if you’ve made a reasonable attempt, even if you didn’t earn 100% on lab01, your team will earn 6 or 7.5 points for your contribution towards the whole.
